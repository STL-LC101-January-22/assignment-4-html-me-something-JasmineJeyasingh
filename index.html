          I have made a small garden in front of my house. In my spare time, I
          work in the garden. I water the plants regularly. I nurse the plants
          with care. I have planted different kinds of flowers like Daisy,
          Dahlia, Sun flowers, Marigold, Zinnia, Gladiolus, and Aster in my
          garden. But I like the Dahlia very much. There are colors of Dahlias
          in my garden. My garden is a source of pleasure to me. When flowers
          bloom in my plants, what a pleasure it is for me! The color of the
          flowers pleases my eyes. Its fragrance cheers up my mind. In fact,
          gardening is my favorite hobby. It is helpful to me in many ways. It
          refreshes my body and mind.
